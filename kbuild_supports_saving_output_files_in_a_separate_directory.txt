from kernel root directory Makefile:

# kbuild supports saving output files in a separate directory.
# To locate output files in a separate directory two syntaxes are supported.
# In both cases the working directory must be the root of the kernel src.
# 1) O=
# Use "make O=dir/to/store/output/files/"
#
# 2) Set KBUILD_OUTPUT
# Set the environment variable KBUILD_OUTPUT to point to the directory
# where the output files shall be placed.
# export KBUILD_OUTPUT=dir/to/store/output/files/
# make
#
# The O= assignment takes precedence over the KBUILD_OUTPUT environment
# variable.

Ex:
  mkdir build/
  make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabi- bcm2711_defconfig O=build/
  time make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabi- zImage modules dtbs O=build/ -j16
